Required: JDK 1.8 version installed

Steps to run:

Step 1: Import project folder Team_07 in your IDE. 

Step 2: Run mainFrame.java

Possible error scenarios: 

When you click on any of the shape icon on the left, and then click on the right pane, the shapes get displayed correctly most of the times. But, sometimes because of the boundaries set, the shapes appear half in size or some overlap is there. We tried fixing it but could not figure out why this overlay was happening. 

On the whole, the project is working fine and attached is a youtube link showing the same for reference. We are trying to improve by fixing the minor glitch.
